<p>In 1962, one of the most successful and critically acclaimed rock bands of all time, the 
    Rolling Stones was started in London. Named after the Muddy Waters song "Rollin' Stone," 
    the original band included frontman Mick Jagger, guitarists Keith Richards and Brian Jones, 
    bassist Bill Wyman, drummer Charlie Watts and pianist Ian Stewart. Guitarist Ron Wood joined 
    Jagger, Richards and Watts in 1975. The Stones, in their various incarnations, have rocked on 
    for more than 50 years, selling more than 200 million albums worldwide. Here's a tribute to the 
    musicians who critics and fans alike have dubbed the "World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band."</p>

<h2 id="intro">In the beginning...</h2>
<p>By the time the Rolling Stones began calling themselves the World's Greatest Rock & Roll Band in 
        the late '60s, they had already staked out an impressive claim on the title. As the self-consciously 
        dangerous alternative to the bouncy Merseybeat of the Beatles in the British Invasion, the Stones had 
        pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock & roll that came to define hard rock. With his 
        preening machismo and latent maliciousness, Mick Jagger became the prototypical rock frontman, tempering 
        his macho showmanship with a detached, campy irony while Keith Richards and Brian Jones wrote the 
        blueprint for sinewy, interlocking rhythm guitars. Backed by the strong yet subtly swinging rhythm 
        section of bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts, the Stones became the breakout band of the 
        British blues scene, eclipsing such contemporaries as the Animals and Them. Over the course of their 
        career, the Stones never really abandoned blues, but as soon as they reached popularity in the U.K., 
        they began experimenting musically, incorporating the British pop of contemporaries like the Beatles, 
        the Kinks, and the Who into their sound. After a brief dalliance with psychedelia, the Stones re-emerged 
        in the late '60s as a jaded, blues-soaked hard rock quintet. They had always flirted with the seedy 
        side of rock & roll, but as the hippie dream began to break apart, they exposed and reveled in the new 
        rock culture. It wasn't without difficulty, of course. Shortly after he was fired from the group, Jones 
        was found dead in a swimming pool, while at a 1969 free concert at Altamont, a concertgoer was brutally 
        killed during a Stones show. But the Stones never stopped going. For the next 50-plus years, they 
        continued to record and perform, and while their records weren't always blockbusters, they were never 
        less than the most visible band of their era -- certainly, none of their British peers continued to 
        be as popular or productive as the Stones. And no band since has proven to have such a broad fan base 
        or such far-reaching popularity, and it is impossible to hear any of the groups that followed them 
        without detecting some sort of influence, whether it was musical or aesthetic.</p>

<p>Throughout their career, Mick Jagger (vocals) and Keith Richards (guitar, vocals) remained at the core 
        of the Rolling Stones. The pair initially met as children at Dartford Maypole County Primary School. 
        They drifted apart over the next ten years, eventually making each other's acquaintance again in 1960, 
        when they met through a mutual friend, Dick Taylor, who was attending Sidcup Art School with Richards. 
        At the time, Jagger was studying at the London School of Economics and playing with Taylor in the blues 
        band Little Boy Blue & the Blue Boys. Shortly afterward, Richards joined the band. Within a year, they 
        had met Brian Jones (guitar, vocals), a Cheltenham native who had dropped out of school to play saxophone 
        and clarinet. By the time he became a fixture on the British blues scene, Jones had already had a wild 
        life. He ran away to Scandinavia when he was 16 and had already fathered two illegitimate children. He 
        returned to Cheltenham after a few months, where he began playing with the Ramrods. Shortly afterward, 
        he moved to London, where he played in Alexis Korner's group, Blues Inc. Jones quickly decided he wanted 
        to form his own group and advertised for members; among those he recruited was the heavyset blues pianist 
        Ian Stewart.</p>

<p>As he played with his group, Jones also moonlighted under the name Elmo Jones at the Ealing Blues Club. 
        At the pub, he became reacquainted with Blues, Inc., which now featured drummer Charlie Watts, and, on occasion, 
        cameos by Jagger and Richards. Jones became friends with Jagger and Richards, and they soon began playing together 
        with Taylor and Stewart; during this time, Mick was elevated to the status of Blues, Inc.'s lead singer. With the 
        assistance of drummer Tony Chapman, the fledgling band recorded a demo tape. After the tape was rejected by EMI, 
        Taylor left the band to attend the Royal College of Art; he would later form the Pretty Things. Before Taylor's 
        departure, the group named itself the Rolling Stones, borrowing the moniker from a Muddy Waters song.</p>

<p>The Rolling Stones gave their first performance at the Marquee Club in London on July 12, 1962. At the time, the group 
        consisted of Jagger, Richards, Jones, pianist Ian Stewart, drummer Mick Avory, and Dick Taylor, who had briefly returned 
        to the fold. Weeks after the concert, Taylor left again and was replaced by Bill Wyman, formerly of the Cliftons. Avory 
        also left the group -- he would later join the Kinks -- and the Stones hired Tony Chapman, who proved to be unsatisfactory. 
        After a few months of persuasion, the band recruited Charlie Watts, who had quit Blues, Inc. to work at an advertising 
        agency once the group's schedule became too hectic. By 1963, the band's lineup had been set, and the Stones began an 
        eight-month residency at the Crawdaddy Club, which proved to substantially increase their fan base. It also attracted 
        the attention of Andrew Loog Oldham, who became the Stones' manager, signing them from underneath the Crawdaddy Club's 
        Giorgio Gomelsky. Although Oldham didn't know much about music, he was gifted at promotion, and he latched upon the 
        idea of fashioning the Stones as the bad-boy opposition to the clean-cut Beatles. At his insistence, the large yet meek 
        Stewart was forced out of the group, since his appearance contrasted with the rest of the group. Stewart didn't disappear 
        from the Stones; he became one of their key roadies and played on their albums and tours until his death in 1985.</p>

<p>With Oldham's help, the Rolling Stones signed with Decca Records, and that June, they released their debut single, a cover of 
        Chuck Berry's "Come On." The single became a minor hit, reaching number 21, and the group supported it with appearances on 
        festivals and package tours. At the end of the year, they released a version of Lennon-McCartney's "I Wanna Be Your Man" that 
        soared into the Top 15. Early in 1964, they released a cover of Buddy Holly's "Not Fade Away," which shot to number three. 
        "Not Fade Away" became their first American hit, reaching number 48 that spring. By that time, the Stones were notorious in 
        their homeland. Considerably rougher and sexier than the Beatles, the Stones were the subject of numerous sensationalistic 
        articles in the British press, culminating in a story about the band urinating in public. All of these stories cemented the 
        group as a dangerous, rebellious band in the minds of the public, and had the effect of beginning a manufactured rivalry 
        between them and the Beatles, which helped the group rocket to popularity in the U.S. In the spring of 1964, the Stones 
        released their eponymous debut album, which was followed by "It's All Over Now," their first U.K. number one.</p>

<header><img src="img/5x5.jpg" alt="Rolling Stones 5 by 5 Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowRight"></header>
<p>That summer, they toured America to riotous crowds, recording the Five by Five EP at Chess Records in Chicago in the midst of the 
        tour. By the time it was over, they had another number one U.K. single with Howlin' Wolf's "Little Red Rooster." Although the Stones 
        had achieved massive popularity, Oldham decided to push Jagger and Richards into composing their own songs, since they -- and his 
        publishing company -- would receive more money that away. In June of 1964, the group released their first original single, "Tell Me 
        (You're Coming Back)," which became their first American Top 40 hit. Shortly afterward, a version of Irma Thomas' "Time Is on My Side" 
        became their first U.S. Top Ten. It was followed by "The Last Time" in early 1965, a number one U.K. and Top Ten U.S. hit that began a 
        virtually uninterrupted string of Jagger-Richards hit singles. Still, it wasn't until the group released "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" 
        in the summer of 1965 that they were elevated to superstars. Driven by a fuzz-guitar riff designed to replicate the sound of a horn 
        section, "Satisfaction" signaled that Jagger and Richards had come into their own as songwriters, breaking away from their blues roots 
        and developing a signature style of big, bluesy riffs and wry, sardonic lyrics. It stayed at number one for four weeks and began a 
        string of Top Ten singles that ran for the next two years, including such classics as "Get Off My Cloud," "19th Nervous Breakdown," 
        "As Tears Go By," and "Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?"</p>
<br>
<h3 class="onLeft">Aftermath</h3>
<header><img src="img/aftermath.jpg" alt="Rolling Stones Aftermath Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowLeft"></header>
<p>By 1966, the Stones had decided to respond to the Beatles' increasingly complex albums with their first album of all-original material, 
        Aftermath. Due to Brian Jones' increasingly exotic musical tastes, the record boasted a wide range of influences, from the sitar-drenched 
        "Paint It, Black" to the Eastern drones of "I'm Going Home." These eclectic influences continued to blossom on Between the Buttons (1967), 
        the most pop-oriented album the group ever made. Ironically, the album's release was bookended by two of the most notorious incidents in 
        the band's history. Before the record was released, the Stones performed the suggestive "Let's Spend the Night Together," the B-side to 
        the medieval ballad "Ruby Tuesday," on The Ed Sullivan Show, which forced Jagger to alter the song's title to an incomprehensible mumble, 
        or else face being banned.</p>

<p>In February of 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested for drug possession, and within three months, Jones was arrested on the same charge. 
        All three were given suspended jail sentences, and the group backed away from the spotlight as the summer of love kicked into gear in 1967. 
        Jagger, along with his then-girlfriend Marianne Faithfull, went with the Beatles to meet the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; they were also prominent 
        in the international broadcast of the Beatles' "All You Need Is Love." Appropriately, the Stones' next single, "Dandelion"/"We Love You," was 
        a psychedelic pop effort, and it was followed by their response to Sgt. Pepper's, Their Satanic Majesties Request, which was greeted with 
        lukewarm reviews.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="onRight">Beggars Banquet</h3>
<header><img src="img/beggars.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones Beggars Banquet Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowRight"></header>
<p>The Stones' infatuation with psychedelia was brief. By early 1968, they had fired Andrew Loog Oldham and hired Allen Klein as their manager. 
        The move coincided with their return to driving rock & roll, which happened to coincide with Richards' discovery of open tunings, a move that 
        gave the Stones their distinctively fat, powerful sound. The revitalized Stones were showcased on the malevolent single "Jumpin' Jack Flash," 
        which climbed to number three in May 1968. Their next album, Beggar's Banquet, was finally released in the fall, after being delayed for five 
        months due its controversial cover art of a dirty, graffiti-laden restroom. An edgy record filled with detours into straight blues and campy 
        country, Beggar's Banquet was hailed as a masterpiece among the fledgling rock press. Although it was seen as a return to form, few realized 
        that while it opened a new chapter of the Stones' history, it was also the end of their time with Brian Jones. Throughout the recording of 
        Beggar's Banquet, Jones was on the sidelines due to his deepening drug addiction and his resentment of the dominance of Jagger and Richards. 
        Jones left the band on June 9, 1969, claiming to be suffering from artistic differences between himself and the rest of the band. On July 3, 
        1969 -- less than a month after his departure -- Jones was found dead in his swimming pool. The coroner ruled that it was "death by 
        misadventure," yet his passing was the subject of countless rumors over the next two years.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="onLeft">Let It Bleed</h3>
<header><img src="img/letitbleed.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones Let It Bleed Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowLeft"></header>
<p>By the time of his death, the Stones had already replaced Jones with Mick Taylor, a former guitarist for John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. He wasn't 
        featured on "Honky Tonk Women," a number one single released days after Jones' funeral, and he contributed only a handful of leads on their next 
        album, Let It Bleed. Released in the fall of 1969, Let It Bleed comprised sessions with Jones and Taylor, yet it continued the direction of 
        Beggar's Banquet, signaling that a new era in the Stones' career had begun, one marked by ragged music and an increasingly wasted sensibility. 
        Following Jagger's filming of Ned Kelly in Australia during the first part of 1969, the group launched its first American tour in three years. 
        Throughout the tour -- the first where they were billed as the World's Greatest Rock & Roll Band -- the group broke attendance records, but it 
        was given a sour note when they staged a free concert at Altamont Speedway. On the advice of the Grateful Dead, the Stones hired Hell's Angels 
        as security, but that plan backfired tragically. The entire show was unorganized and in shambles, and it turned tragic when the Angels killed a 
        young black man, Meredith Hunter, during the Stones' performance. In the wake of the public outcry, the Stones again retreated from the 
        spotlight and dropped "Sympathy for the Devil," which some critics ignorantly claimed incited the violence, from their set. As the group 
        entered a hiatus, they released the live Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! in the fall of 1970. It was their last album for Decca/London, and they formed 
        Rolling Stones Records, which became a subsidiary of Atlantic Records.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="onRight">Sticky Fingers</h3>
<header><img src="img/stickyFingers.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones Sticky Fingers Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowRight"></header>
<p>During 1970, Jagger starred in Nicolas Roeg's cult film Performance and married Nicaragua model Bianca Perez Morena de Macias; the couple quickly 
        entered high society. As Jagger was jet-setting, Richards was slumming, hanging out with country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons. Keith wound up having 
        more musical influence on 1971's Sticky Fingers, the first album the Stones released through their new label. Following its release, the band 
        retreated to France in tax exile, where they shared a house and recorded a double album, Exile on Main St. Upon its May 1972 release, Exile on 
        Main St. was widely panned, but over time it came to be considered one of the group's defining moments.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="onLeft">Goats Head Soup</h3>
<header><img src="img/goatheadsoup.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones Goats Head Soup Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowLeft"></header>
<p>Following Exile, the Stones began to splinter in two, as Jagger concentrated on being a celebrity and Richards sank into drug addiction. The band 
        remained popular throughout the '70s, but their critical support waned. Goats Head Soup, released in 1973, reached number one, as did 1974's It's 
        Only Rock 'n' Roll, but neither record was particularly well received. Taylor left the band after It's Only Rock 'n' Roll, and the group recorded 
        their next album as they auditioned new lead guitarists, including Jeff Beck. They finally settled on Ron Wood, former lead guitarist for the Faces 
        and Rod Stewart, in 1976, the same year they released Black n' Blue, which only featured Wood on a handful of cuts. During the mid- and late '70s, 
        all the Stones pursued side projects, with both Wyman and Wood releasing solo albums with regularity. Richards was arrested in Canada in 1977 with 
        his common-law wife Anita Pallenberg for heroin possession. After his arrest, he cleaned up and was given a suspended sentence the following year.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="onRight">Some Girls</h3>
<header><img src="img/somegirls.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones Some Girls Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowRight"></header>
<p>The band reconvened in 1978 to record Some Girls, an energetic response to punk, new wave, and disco. The record and its first single, the thumping disco-rocker "Miss You," both reached number one, and the album restored the group's image. However, the band squandered that goodwill with the follow-up, Emotional Rescue, a number one record that nevertheless received lukewarm reviews upon its 1980 release. Tattoo You, released the following year, fared better both critically and commercially, as the singles "Start Me Up" and "Waiting on a Friend" helped the album spend nine weeks at number one. The Stones supported Tattoo You with an extensive stadium tour captured in Hal Ashby's movie Let's Spend the Night Together and the 1982 live album Still Life.
    </p>
<br>
<h3 class="onLeft">Undercover</h3>
<header><img src="img/undercover.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones Undercover Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowLeft"></header>
<p>Tattoo You proved to be the last time the Stones completely dominated the charts and the stadiums. Although the group continued to sell out concerts in the '80s and '90s, their records didn't sell as well as previous efforts, partially because the albums suffered due to Jagger and Richards' notorious mid-'80s feud. Starting with 1983's Undercover, the duo were conflicted about which way the band should go, with Jagger wanting the Stones to follow contemporary trends and Richards wanting them to stay true to their rock roots. As a result, Undercover was a mean-spirited, unfocused record that received relatively weak sales and mixed reviews. Released in 1986, Dirty Work suffered a worse fate, since Jagger was preoccupied with his fledgling solo career. Once Jagger decided that the Stones would not support Dirty Work with a tour, Richards decided to make his own solo record with 1988's Talk Is Cheap. Appearing a year after Jagger's failed second solo album, Talk Is Cheap received good reviews and went gold, prompting Jagger and Richards to reunite late in 1988.
    </p>
<br>
<h3 class="onRight">Steel Wheels</h3>
<header><img src="img/steelwheels.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones Steel Wheels Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowRight"></header>
The following year, the Stones released Steel Wheels, which was received with good reviews, but the record was overshadowed by its supporting tour, which grossed over 140 million dollars and broke many box office records. In 1991, the live album Flashpoint, which was culled from the Steel Wheels shows, was released. Following the release, Bill Wyman left the band; he published a memoir, Stone Alone, within a few years of leaving. The Stones didn't immediately replace Wyman, since they were all working on solo projects; this time, there was none of the animosity surrounding their mid-'80s projects.
<br>
<h3 class="onLeft">Voodoo Lounge</h3>
<header><img src="img/voodoo.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones Voodoo Lounge Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowLeft"></header>
<p>The group reconvened in 1994 with bassist Darryl Jones, who had previously played with Miles Davis and Sting, to record and release the Don Was-produced Voodoo Lounge. The album received the band's strongest reviews in years, and its accompanying tour was even more successful than the Steel Wheels tour. On top of being more successful than its predecessor, Voodoo Lounge also won the Stones their first Grammy for Best Rock Album. Upon the completion of the Voodoo Lounge tour, the Stones released the live "unplugged" album Stripped in the fall of 1995. Similarly, after wrapping up their tour in support of 1997's Bridges to Babylon, the group issued yet another live set, No Security, the following year. A high-profile greatest-hits tour in 2002 was launched despite the lack of a studio album to support, and its album document, Live Licks, appeared in 2004. A year later, the group issued A Bigger Bang, their third effort with producer Don Was.
    </p>
<br>
<h3 class="onRight">Shine a Light</h3>
<header><img src="img/shine.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones Shine a Light Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowRight"></header>
<p>In 2006, Martin Scorsese filmed two of the group's performances at New York City's Beacon Theatre. The resulting Shine a Light, which included guest appearances from Buddy Guy, Jack White, and Christina Aguilera, was released in theaters in 2008. The accompanying soundtrack reached the number two spot on the U.K. charts. Following Shine a Light, the Stones turned their attention toward their legacy. For Keith Richards, this meant delving into writing his autobiography Life -- the memoir was published to acclaim in the fall of 2010 and generated some controversy due to comments Keith made about Mick -- but the Stones in general spent time mining their archives, something they'd previously avoided. In 2010, they released a super deluxe edition of Exile on Main St. that contained a bonus disc of rarities and outtakes, including a few newly finished songs like "Plundered My Soul." This was followed in 2011 by a super deluxe edition of Some Girls that also contained unheard songs and outtakes. That same year, the Stones opened up their Rolling Stones Archive, which offered official digital releases of classic live bootlegs like 1973's The Brussels Affair.
    </p>
<br>
<h3 class="onLeft">GRRR!</h3>
<header><img src="img/grrr.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones GRRR! Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowLeft"></header>
<p>All this was a prelude to their 50th anniversary in 2012, which the group celebrated with a hardcover book, a new documentary called Crossfire Hurricane, and a new compilation called GRRR! The Stones also played a handful of star-studded concerts at the end of the year and in the first half of 2013, several of which featured guest spots from the long-departed Mick Taylor. These live shows culminated with a headlining spot at Glastonbury and two July 2013 concerts at Hyde Park; highlights from the Hyde Park shows were released that July and, later in the year, there was a home video/CD release of the concert called Sweet Summer Sun: Live in Hyde Park.
    </p>
<br>
<h3 class="onRight">Blue & Lonesome</h3>
<header><img src="img/blue.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones Blue & Lonesome Album Cover" width="200" height="200" class="flowRight"></header>
<p>Over the next few years, the Stones played concerts regularly -- a highlight was a March 2016 concert in Havana, Cuba -- and slowly worked on an album that was teased in September 2016, the same week their London/Decca works were released as the box set The Rolling Stones in Mono. On December 2, 2016, the Stones released Blue & Lonesome, a collection of Chicago blues covers that was their first studio album in 11 years. The Stones had two major archival projects released in the last quarter of 2017: a 50th anniversary edition of Their Satanic Majesties Request and On Air, the first official release of their '60s BBC recordings. The band's 2018 No Filter tour of Europe spilled over into 2019 when they announced it would include a massive stadium tour of the U.S. The tour was delayed due to Jagger's need for emergency heart surgery, but the release of the new compilation Honk was undisturbed. Concentrating on music made since 1971, Honk appeared in April 2019. Later that year saw the arrival of the live LP/concert film Bridges to Bremen, which captured the group performing in the German city on September 2, 1998 in support of the Bridges to Babylon album.
